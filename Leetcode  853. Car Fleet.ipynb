    "The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.\n",
    "The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.\n",
    "The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target."
